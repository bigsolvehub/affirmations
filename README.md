## HTTP Callout in Flow

Build a Screen Flow using the HTTP Callout action in Flow to generate random affirmations for your Users.

1. Create `Affirmations` External Credential
2. Create `Affirmations` Named Credential
3. Create `Affirmations` Permission Set
4. Create `Affirmations Screen Flow`
5. Add the `Affirmations Screen Flow` to the Home Page
